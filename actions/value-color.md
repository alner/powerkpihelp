The action will set the font color, background color or border color by using the measure value and the one of the predefined algorithms: “Positive/Negative”, “Less than 100%”, “Heatmap”.

{% hint style="info" %}
This action can be applied on a cell linked with the dimension or measure
{% endhint %}

In case of the "Line" property a border color will be set  with the help of the action \(if the borders were applied on the cell\). The icon color can be set by selecting "Symbol" value.
