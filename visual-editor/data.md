# Data

“Data” section of toolbar contains the following buttons:

* ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2868%29.png)  - **open data panel** containing dimensions and measures which can be bonded to cell using simple drag-and-drop:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2869%29.png)

Data panel will show all dimensions \(if has been used\) and measures which have been added to Data section of the property panel.

Each dimension and measure contain “Label” ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2852%29.png) button, which will allow you to bind dimension/measure label within the template. Each measure, except the “Label” button, contains “Totals”   ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png) button. It allows you to bind total calculated for appropriate measure within the template. It makes sense to use “Totals” when constructing table-like templates. 

To bind a measure/dimension with the appropriate cell, select cell and click the appropriate measure/dimension. Or, if you prefer, drag data item \(dimension, measure, label or total\) onto template and drop it on the appropriate cell. In such a way you will bind your data assets to the designed template.

* ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2837%29.png) -   **open “Tags” panel** which will allow you to make markup of template to be able to build table-like views \(it makes sense to use only for table-like views with dimensions\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

For table-like templates you will have to select row numbers which correspond to details rows, and then to click on “Rows” tag ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2870%29.png).

In such a way you will always have to tag details rows for table-like templates:

![](../.gitbook/assets/2019-04-02_10-53-45.gif)

If you need to change your markup, you can click on ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png) icon to remove markup and to tag your rows in a different way.

* ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28104%29.png)   - **insert any text into the selected cell**

![](../.gitbook/assets/2019-04-02_11-08-04.gif)

* \*\*\*\*![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png) ****- **insert an icon into the selected cell**

![](../.gitbook/assets/2019-04-02_11-05-29.gif)

It allows you to choose an icon, the position \(left or right from the content in a cell\), icon font and font size.

* ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2898%29.png)- **insert an image** in the selected cell from a content library
