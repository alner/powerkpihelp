Visual editor allows you to create and edit visualization templates, which can be added using property panel of the component \(see section “Visualizations” of the documentation\).

{% page-ref page="../properties/visualizations.md" %}

Spreadsheet-like visual editor allows developers to visually design stunning-looking, responsive and interactive visualizations: from simple kpi to interactive fancy and stunning-looking "table-like" data views \(with the ability to build custom multiline detailed row templates\).

To create an appropriate visualization template, you should add columns/rows, merge cells in accordance with the requirements. You should bind dimensions and measures with the template, and then apply various styles options – fonts, alignment, borders, colors, backgrounds.
