A Field can be entered manually or selected by clicking the ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28122%29.png) button.

The “Value” parameter can contain a mask. Special symbol **\*** can be used in a mask_._ The  **\*** symbol means any combination of characters. E.g. to find items containing ‘air’ substring the following mask can be used: \*air\*. But if you need items which start with ‘air’ substring, the following mask can be used: air\*. The operation is case insensitive.

The “Soft lock” parameter will allow you to override locked selections.

Qlik expressions can be used in “Field” and “Value” parameters by prefixing each of them with an equals sign.
